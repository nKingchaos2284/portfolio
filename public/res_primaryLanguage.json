    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Jose Mauricio Cabrera Elias, but almost everyone calls
    me 'Joey.' Welcome to my software engineering portfolio. Here you'll get
    to experience some of the apps I have developed. I see things in a
    different way, and I create as such. I think in logic, which makes
    coding come easy to me, and I flow with the code. I also follow to stoic
    way of living, all is Logos. Let me introduce my self. I served in the
    military for twelve years, two branches, first the US Navy and then the
    US Army. Yes, I am a war veteran. I have always loved technology, I like
    to know how things function deep inside. I used to build computers in
    high school(the late 90's) also install software, and troubleshoot on
    family and friends computers. I've was a Gas Turbine electrician
    technician, and in the civilian industry I worked in the process
    engineering industry, that's where I got deep into programing, I
    uploaded and updated software in a field environment. Wrote logic and
    edited for PLC's(Programable Logic controllers) and also a bit of
    robotics. Now, I have found something I'm good at and that's always
    evolving. I love to create. Hopefully you enjoy my work. Thanks for
    visiting!Thank you ðŸ’œ",
